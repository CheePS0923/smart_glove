# Smart Glove for Object Recognition

This project is focused on using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for object recognition based on sensor data. The project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms, in particular, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and SVM as a classifier, can be used to recognize objects of different shapes and sizes with high accuracy.

For more detailed explanations and results, please refer to our [paper](link-to-paper).

## About The Project

In this project, we have utilized sensor data to train and evaluate an SVM model for object recognition. The data includes different objects such as spheres, cubes, and complex shapes like dodecahedrons. The model achieved a prediction accuracy of 98.75%.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
